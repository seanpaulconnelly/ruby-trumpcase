Only my two step plan can make your rails project great again:

1. Add this line to your Gemfile

```
gem 'trumpcase', git: 'git://github.com/seanpaulconnelly/ruby-trumpcase.git'
```

2. Use my very secure code. Did I mention made entirely in America?

```
> "America first".trumpcase
> "AMERICA FIRST"
```
